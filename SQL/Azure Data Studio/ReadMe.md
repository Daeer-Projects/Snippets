# Read Me

These snippets can be used in the Azure Data Studio application.

## Purpose

I created these snippets as I found it easier to type less when I wanted to do something.  As snippets are designed for.

Some of the snippets are based on snippets provided by RedGates SQL Prompt.  They are not quite the same, but very similar.

The Azure Data Studio has many snippets already provided, but I found it was lacking in some areas.

## Installation

1. Use CTRL + SHIFT + P to open the quick search
2. Type "snippets" into the search
3. Select the "Preferences: Configure User Snippets"
4. Select the "sql.json" file
5. Copy and paste in the snippets you want to use into the file
6. Save the file
7. Snippet away!

## Contributions

Anyone can contribute to these snippets.  Either by adding, or altering them.

I look forward to seeing more pointless snippets as well as the more useful ones.
