These snippets can be used in the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) application.

## Purpose

I created these snippets as I found it easier to type less when I wanted to do something.  As snippets are designed for.

Some of the snippets are based on snippets provided by RedGates SQL Prompt.  They are not quite the same, but very similar.

The snippets provided in the SSMS seem to be lacking in more of the fun stuff.

## Installation

1. Copy the snippet files from this repository
2. Locate where your user defined snippets are stored
   1. Usually somewhere like: "Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Code Snippets\SQL\My Code Snippets"
   2. Where "Documents" is the standard document file for the user logged into Windows
3. Paste the snippets into the "My Code Snippets" folder
4. Open SSMS
5. Snippet away!

## Snippets

* yell - Lets your frustration out
* wtf - Might be what you are thinking
* womm - The classic "Works on my machine!" saying

## Contributions

Anyone can contribute to these snippets.  Either by adding, or altering them.

I look forward to seeing more pointless snippets as well as the more useful ones.
