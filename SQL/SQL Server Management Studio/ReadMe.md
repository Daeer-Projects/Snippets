These snippets can be used in the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) application.

## Purpose

I created these snippets as I found it easier to type less when I wanted to do something.  As snippets are designed for.

The snippets provided in the SSMS seem to be lacking in more of the fun stuff.

There are tools available that add snippets into SSMS, these include DevArt SQL Complete and ApexSQL.  For those who do not want to install these tools, we will add more useful snippets to this repository.

## Installation

1. Download the repository and extract the files
2. Open SSMS
3. From the "Tools" menu, select the "Code Snippets Manager" option
4. For each / all of the snippets you want:
5. Click the "Import..." button
6. Navigate to the extracted snippets
7. Select the snippet(s) and click "Open"
8. This will import them to the "My Code Snippets" folder
9. Snippet away!

## Snippets

* yell - Lets your frustration out
* wtf - Might be what you are thinking
* womm - The classic "Works on my machine!" saying

## Contributions

Anyone can contribute to these snippets.  Either by adding, or altering them.

I look forward to seeing more pointless snippets as well as the more useful ones.
